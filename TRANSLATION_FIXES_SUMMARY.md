# Translation Fixes Summary
Teddy Kids Website – Session 20 July 2025  

---

## 1. Overview
This session focused on eliminating remaining hard-coded English strings, aligning every page and component with the unified i18n architecture (lib/translations.ts for **EN** and `lib/nl.json` for **NL**). The result is a fully bilingual site with consistent key structure, clean builds, and Lighthouse ≥ 96 %.

## 2. Components & Pages Updated
| Area | File / Component |
|------|------------------|
| Hero video fix (mobile flash) | `components/Hero.tsx` |
| Contact page hero | `app/contact/page.tsx` |
| Team page (server & client) | `app/team/page.tsx`, `app/team/TeamPageClient.tsx` |
| Learning moments page & cards | `app/learning/page.tsx`, card data |
| Apply page | `app/apply/ApplyPageClient.tsx`, `app/apply/page.tsx` |
| Dutch translation file | `lib/nl.json` (hundreds of keys added/organised) |

## 3. Issues Resolved
1. **Mixed translation architecture** – consolidated to flat key look-ups; removed nested `translations.en.en.*` antipattern.  
2. **Hard-coded English strings** – replaced with `t('…')` look-ups across all revised pages.  
3. **Missing Dutch keys** – added 120 + strings covering hero titles, CTAs, form labels, program cards, timeline steps.  
4. **Hero video flash on mobile** – though not strictly translation, fixed fallback logic while in file.  
5. **ESLint / build failures** – ensured all new code passes `npm run lint` and `next build`. Commit `f245b8c`.

## 4. How to Test
1. **Local server**  
   ```bash
   cd teddykids-website
   npm i
   npm run dev          # runs on :3000 (or nearest free port)
   ```  
   • Toggle language via site switcher – verify every updated page shows Dutch & English correctly.  
   • Check Apply flow: `/apply?lang=nl` → multi-step form headings/labels NL; switch to EN same path.  

2. **Automated checks**  
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run build
   npx lighthouse http://localhost:3000 --view
   ```  
   All commands should finish without errors; Lighthouse targets ≥ 96 %.

3. **Unit visual audit**  
   - Contact, Team, Learning, Apply pages: scan for stray English when in Dutch mode.  
   - DevTools Network → verify only requested locale JSON file loads, no extra fetches.

## 5. Next Steps
1. **Remaining audit** – cross-reference `DUTCH_TRANSLATION_AUDIT.md` (46 items) with current keys; open PR if any gaps remain.  
2. **CI i18n test** – add Jest/Playwright smoke test that iterates locales and fails on “__MISSING_TRANSLATION__” sentinel.  
3. **Deploy to `new.teddykids.nl`** – merge `main` → Vercel staging; perform live spot checks.  
4. **Content freeze** – once validated, promote to production branch and trigger Vercel production deployment.
