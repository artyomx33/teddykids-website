I notice you're asking me to create a binary image file (banana-icon.png), but I cannot directly generate or create binary files like images in my response. The image you uploaded needs to be manually saved to the path:

```
public/images/icons/banana-icon.png
```

Let me help you with the next step instead - updating the Navigation component to use the new icon with 33% opacity. Would you like me to make that change now, assuming you'll save the image to the correct location?
