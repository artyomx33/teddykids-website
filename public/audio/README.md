# Teddy Kids ‚Äì Audio Assets

Welcome to the `public/audio/` directory of the Teddy Kids website.  
This folder stores **all sound assets that are shipped to the browser** (e.g. greetings, ambience clips, voice-overs).

---

## 1. Folder Purpose
* Central place for any audio that must be publicly reachable under `/audio/*`.
* Keeps binary media out of `app/` and makes Next.js static asset handling straightforward.

## 4. Adding or Replacing Audio Files

1. Produce or receive the final audio file that meets the specifications in section 2.  
2. Place the `.mp3` inside `public/audio/`.  
3. **Update references** in the React/Next.js components if the file name differs.  
   * Example: `<audio src="/audio/your-file.mp3" controls />`
4. Commit the binary with Git LFS if the repository uses it, otherwise commit normally.
5. Push to `main` ‚Äì Vercel will redeploy automatically.

---

## 5. Technical Recommendations & Tips

* Perform a short **fade-in/fade-out (50-100 ms)** to avoid clicks.
* Export at the **original sample rate**; avoid resampling multiples times.
* If editing in Audacity/DAW, apply gentle compression to even out peaks before loudness normalisation.
* Run files through [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) for final encode, e.g.:

```
ffmpeg -i input.wav -ar 44100 -ac 2 -b:a 160k -compression_level 0 appies-welcome.mp3
```

* Test playback on:
  * Chrome, Firefox, Safari (desktop & mobile)
  * Low-bandwidth connection (use DevTools throttling) to ensure quick start.
