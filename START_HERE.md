# 🚨 STOP! READ THIS FIRST 🚨

Welcome to the Teddy Kids codebase.  
Before you touch **any** file —​human _or_ AI —​you **must** read the guides below.

| Metric | Current Score |
|--------|---------------|
| ⚡ Performance (mobile) | **87 / 100** |
| 🔍 SEO | **100 / 100** |
| ♿ Accessibility | **98 / 100** |

These numbers are hard-won. Ignoring the guides will tank them.

## 📚 Essential Guides

| File | Why you need it |
|------|-----------------|
| **[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)** | Setup, code-quality rules, pre-commit hooks & Husky instructions that keep builds green. |
| **[DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md](./DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)** | Full architecture & best-practice handbook: performance phases, SEO, a11y, file structure, commit rules. |
| **[QUICK_CHECKLIST.md](./QUICK_CHECKLIST.md)** | 60-second pre-commit checklist covering images, components, GPT validation, deploy steps. |

## 💥 What happens if you skip the rules?

* ⏱️ **Slower LCP** → frustrated parents leave.  
* 🕳️ **SEO drop** → fewer visitors find us.  
* ⚠️ **A11y regressions** → legal & ethical risks.  
* 📦 **Bundle bloat** → higher mobile data costs.  
* 😢 **Crying toddlers** (okay, maybe not… but don’t risk it!).

## 🤖  Note for AI Assistants

ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Factory Droids and friends:  
**You must also follow the two guides above** — particularly the _GPT Code Review_ section in **QUICK_CHECKLIST.md**. Failure to comply will cause your PR to be rejected.

Happy (guideline-compliant) coding! 🎉
