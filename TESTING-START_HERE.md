## 🤖 For Teachers & Managers

Need a quick copy tweak or new photo on the site but don’t speak “Git”?  
Use **Teddy Web FixBot** – a friendly ChatGPT assistant that gathers your change requests in warm Brutal Luna style and hands them to the devs in ready-to-implement format.

👉 Chat here: <https://chatgpt.com/g/g-687ba8eb97b48191a0163468dbd97fb8-teddy-web-fixbot>

How it fits the workflow: FixBot creates a ticket-style summary that lands in our backlog; a developer then follows the guides above to implement, test and deploy. No extra meetings, no jargon – just faster improvements for parents and kids. 🎈

## 💥 Skip the rules, pay the price

• ⏱️ **Slower LCP** → parents bounce  
• 🕳️ **SEO drop** → fewer sign-ups  
• ⚠️ **A11y regressions** → legal & ethical risk  
• 📦 **Bundle bloat** → higher mobile data bills  
• 🧸 **Sad toddlers** (okay, maybe not… but don’t risk it)

## 🤖 Note for AI Assistants

ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Factory Droids & friends — follow the guides above, especially the **GPT Code Review** in _QUICK_CHECKLIST.md_.  
Future projects: clone, then run `npm run init-setup` to auto-enable Husky, ESLint, LHCI baseline **and** default every new page to **server components** (SSR/SSG first, no top-level `'use client'`). Ignore this and your PR will be rejected.

Happy, guideline-compliant coding! 🎉
