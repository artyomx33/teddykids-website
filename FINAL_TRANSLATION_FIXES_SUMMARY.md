# Final Translation Fixes – Comprehensive Summary  
Teddy Kids Website • Sessions 20 July 2025  

---

## 1. Goal  
Deliver a fully bilingual (EN/NL) experience across all public pages by replacing every hard-coded English string with translation keys and filling **lib/nl.json** with Dutch equivalents. Secondary goals: tidy UI glitches (hero alignment, AppiesGPT placement, hero video flash) and keep Lighthouse ≥ 96 %.

## 2. Translation & UI Fixes Completed

| Area | What Was Fixed |
|------|----------------|
| **Global** | • Consolidated flat key structure (`useTranslation` hook). <br>• Added ≈ 320 Dutch keys (contact form, learning cards, location apply flow, CTA copy, category filters, validation messages). |
| **Hero Component** | • Fixed mobile flash by deferring video. <br>• Deep-link “Apply Now” button to `/apply#application-form`. |
| **Learning Page** | • Category badges now translated (`t(learningMoments.categories.*)`). <br>• Added NL for cards 5 & 6 (“Sinterklaas”, “Teddy Garden”). <br>• CTA block fully translated. |
| **Contact Page** | • Hero text centred & translated. <br>• All form labels/placeholders/buttons now use keys. <br>• AppiesGPT widget moved directly under hero for visibility. |
| **Team, About, Locations, Programs** | • Remaining stray English replaced (section subtitles, buttons, policy reports). |
| **Apply Page (initial pass)** | • Hero title/subtitle translated. <br>• Audio section headings translated. <br>• Home timeline “How it Works” buttons wired to keys. |
| **Dutch Translation File (`lib/nl.json`)** | • Added missing nesting for contact, learningMoments, hero, applyPage, etc. |
| **Lint / Build** | • ESLint passes; `next build` succeeds. |

## 3. How to Test

### 3.1 Manual Browser Test
1. `npm run dev` → visit `http://localhost:3000`.  
2. Toggle language switcher on each route:  
   • `/`, `/about`, `/team`, `/learning`, `/locations`, `/contact`, `/apply`.  
3. Check that **all** visible copy changes (hero, CTA, form, cards, buttons).  
4. Resize to mobile – confirm hero video replaced by image, WhatsApp FAB doesn’t overlap vital CTAs.

### 3.2 Automated Quick-check
```
npm run lint          # zero errors
npm run build         # static export succeeds
npx lighthouse http://localhost:3000?lang=nl --view
```
Targets: Performance ≥ 96, SEO 100, Accessibility ≥ 98.

### 3.3 (Optional) Regex Sweep
```
grep -R --exclude-dir=node_modules "[A-Za-z]\{4,\}" app | grep -v t(
```
No raw English strings should surface in `NL` mode.

## 4. Remaining Attention / Next Sprint

1. **Apply multi-step form**: inner steps & validation still partially English; requires new keys under `locationsPage.applyPage.form.*`.
2. **WhatsApp FAB overlap**: adjust z-index or convert to speed-dial so it doesn’t obscure corner CTA buttons (screenshot in chat).
3. **Automated i18n Jest test**: render every route in `nl` locale, fail on `__MISSING_TRANSLATION__` sentinel or regex for English.
4. **Newsletter block on Learning page**: currently commented until translated + connected to backend.
5. **Dutch validation error messages**: contact & apply forms still show English error text; map to `t('errors.required')`, etc.

## 5. Deployment Checklist
- [x] Merge `main` → Vercel staging (`new.teddykids.nl`).
- [ ] Stakeholder NL review.
- [ ] Close remaining tasks above, push patch.
- [ ] Promote to production (`teddykids.nl`).
